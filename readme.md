# Windows Setup From Scratch
I have faced timeless instances where after installing windows, I have to sit and recall which softwares are the most essential once and we damn as well need in our daily lives. Starting from media player and image viewer to vcredist for games. Well, I have tried to jot them all down so that it helps everyone. 

This repo will contain
- Microsoft Windows and Offie Downloads
- Essential software to install
- System configuration steps
- Useful PowerShell commands
- Customization tips

and maybe more.

## Windows ISO Download
In this step, all you gotta have is one simple PC [borrow from friend or whatever] and follow the steps.

- ISO file download - https://massgrave.dev/genuine-installation-media. <br> Remember windows comes in 2 editions, consumer and business. For "Windows Home" download the Consumer edition and for "Windows Pro, Workstation or Education" download the Business Edition ISO.
- Rufus for making it bootable - https://rufus.ie/en/. 

After this all you will need is a Pendrive probably 32GB and you are good to run rufus, select the ISO and you are good to start.

## Windows Installation
During installation, windows gives you options to install various versions:

- Windows Home
- Windows Pro
- Windows Education
- Windows Education N
