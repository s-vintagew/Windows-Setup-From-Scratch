## Windows Installation
In this step, all you gotta have is one simple PC [borrow from friend or whatever] and follow the steps.

- ISO file download - https://massgrave.dev/genuine-installation-media. <br> Remember windows comes in 2 editions, consumer and business. For "Windows Home" download the Consumer edition and for "Windows Pro, Workstation or Education" download the Business Edition ISO.
- Rufus for making it bootable - https://rufus.ie/en/. 

After this all you will need is a Pendrive probably 32GB and you are good to run rufus, select the ISO and you are good to start.
